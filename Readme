Problem Statement

Forecasting Trail Traffic
The Austin Parks department has time series data on foot and bike traffic on a trail near downtown Austin. This data is influenced by a number of conditions, including weather, time of year, day of week, major and minor events, openings of new 
business and event spaces, and other more difficult-to-predict events and trends. Using historical data, participants will attempt to develop models that capture these sources of variability in the data and forecast future expected traffic on various locations 
within the trails. This should include models, statistics, visualizations, and, potentially, interfacing components to allow models to be retrained and/or queried.

We won the Best Innovation Prize for this project for developing a heuristic based manpower hiring strategy model along with models for short and long term forecast.
